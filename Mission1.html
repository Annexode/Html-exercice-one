 <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
  <br>
  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
  <br>
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
  <br>
  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
  <br>
  remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
  <br>
  of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
  <br>
  and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
